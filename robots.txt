# AEM robots.txt FAQ
#
# Q: This looks like a default robots.txt, how can I provide my own?
# A: Add the contents of your robots.txt to your site configuration:
# https://labs.aem.live/tools/robots-edit/index.html
#
# Q: Why am I seeing this robots.txt instead of the one I
# configured?
# A: You are visiting from *.aem.page or *.aem.live - in order
# to prevent these sites from showing up in search engines and
# giving you a duplicate content penalty on your real site we
# exclude all robots
#
# Q: What do you mean with "real site"?
# A: If you add a custom domain to this site (e.g.
# example.com), then Franklin detects that you are ready for
# production and serves your own robots.txt - but only on
# example.com
#
# Q: This does not answer my questions at all. What can I do?
# A: Head to your Teams or Slack channel, or ask us on Discord:
